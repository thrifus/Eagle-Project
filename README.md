# Eagle Project

I should have done this earlier, but oh well. Maybe I'll re-copy the stuff over to a blank document later or something.

Fortunately I learned early on that there is some sort of bug in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC that does not allow you to change the values of formatted form inputs, so that's why I'm putting this file into a git repo so I can switch back if something goes wrong.
